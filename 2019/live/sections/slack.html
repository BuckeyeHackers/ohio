<h1>Slack</h1>
<p>
This year we are using Slack as the platform for communication. It can be used through a web browser, web application and/or mobile app. 
You will have to create your own login to enter our slack workspace. In slack, there are dedicated channels for directed topics of conversation. 
Feel free to network and contact mentors if you are having any issues. Please use this link to join our workspace:
