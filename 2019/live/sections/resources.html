<h1 class="title">Starting out?</h1>
<div class="container" style="padding:0px 45px 15px">
    New to programming? No problem! Hackathons are a great opportunity to learn new things.
    <br>
    Building projects is a great way to learn as you go. This page contains links to free stuff and resources to help HackOHI/O participants out, but it definitely doesn't end here.
    Use your favorite search engines to find new tools, tutorials, programming languages, and more - and if you ever get stuck or need suggestions, <a class="pretty-link" href="https://hackohio-helpq.herokuapp.com/">call a mentor</a>!
    <br><br>
    If you're new to programming, we suggest building your own personal website first.
    It's a great way to get into development by getting you to create and publish your first real project - and it can serve as the start of a place for you to continue to try new things and experiment.

<h1 class="title">Text Editors</h1>
<div class="container" style="padding:0px 45px 0px">
    Before you even get started, you need a place to write code!
    A text editor is a piece of software that facilities the writing of code. Note that programs like Microsoft Word and Google Docs are word processors, not text editors!
    <br><br>
    There are a ton of text editors out there; over time, you gain exposure to more and more and acquire your favorites.
    Here's a list of some of the most popular you can try out:
    <br>
    <ul>
    <a class="pretty-link" href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>
    <br>
    <a class="pretty-link" href="https://atom.io/">Atom Editor</a>
    <br>

    <a class="pretty-link" href="http://brackets.io//">Brackets</a>
</div>

<h1 class="title">Version Control</h1>
<div class="container" style="padding:0px 45px 15px">
    When you write code, you want an easy way to track changes and collaborate with others.
    Git is a version control tool that does just that. It keeps track of all the changes to each file, and keeps a running history over time.
    GitHub is a code hosting platform that works with Git to cleanly store and view projects online at GitHub.com.

    Check out <a class="pretty-link" href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/">this GitHub tutorial</a> to learn the basics of GitHub and how to use it.

<h1 class="title">Web Development</h1>
<div class="container" style="padding:0px 45px 15px">
    Basic web development starts with three things: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    HTML is a markup language where you define the elements that go into a page.
    CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets"; it gives you control to style, format, and position your HTML elements.
    JavaScript adds behavior to a page, such as working forms, dragging and dropping, animating things, and so on.
