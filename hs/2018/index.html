					<h4 >Zero to Hero with React -- Kevin McCartney</h4>
					<p>Over the past few years, React.js has been taking over front-end web development. React makes building component-based, declarative user interfaces fun & simple. It can be difficult, however, to get started with the new paradigms & tools that come along with this library. In this interactive workshop, you will be introduced to the core concepts of React as we walk through the process of building a small React application. You will walk away with enough knowledge to get started building more of your own React applications & a fully-functional UI element living in the wild.
					</p>
				</div>
					<div class="col-sm-6 text-center">
					<h4 >The Physics of Video Games</h4>
					<p>Have you ever thought about what the computer is doing behind the scenes to run your favorite video games? In this workshop we will do some simple coding activities from the STEMcoding hour of code that highlights games like asteroids and angry birds. Then we will have a friendly competition to see who can modify these codes to make the most interesting game by adding hand-drawn art and other features to the code. The winners will get a chance to highlight their game on the <a href = "http://go.osu.edu/STEMtube">STEMcoding youtube channel</a>. No prior coding knowledge required!</p>
				</div>
</div>
<div class = "row">
				<div class="col-sm-6 text-center">
					<h4 >Computer Vision</h4>
					<p>The Computer Vision workshop will introduce students to the basics of computer vision, computer vision libraries, and computer vision methods. Computer Vision (CV) is how computers obtain information from images using, primarily, matrix operations. This workshop will discuss some of the recent history in computer vision and demonstrate examples of how products like Snapchat use CV in their applications.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-6 text-center">
					<h4 >Women in STEM</h4>
					If you're a woman considering a STEM career, you want to know what you're getting into. Come learn about my experience as a woman in engineering--from the facts of the field to my observations, struggles, and accomplishments so far, both in and out of the classroom!

					<h4>Github Workshop</h4>
					Get some firsthand experience working with the world's leading software development platform! I will be running a workshop that allows you to create a Github account and get familiar with the website and Github desktop application by doing a fun activity--you'll even get to learn some HTML!
